D:\AndroidStudioProjects\Spot\android\app\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml:6: Error: MainActivity must extend android.app.Activity [Instantiatable]
            android:name=".MainActivity"
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "Instantiatable":
   Activities, services, broadcast receivers etc. registered in the manifest
   file (or for custom views, in a layout file) must be "instantiatable" by
   the system, which means that the class must be public, it must have an
   empty public constructor, and if it's an inner class, it must be a static
   inner class.

   If you use a custom AppComponentFactory to instantiate app components
   yourself, consider disabling this Lint issue in order to avoid false
   positives.
